    <p>
      Though the material is predictable and formulaic, 
      Reese Witherspoon's funny, nuanced performance makes this movie better than it would have been otherwise.
    </p>

    <p>
      Led by Reese Witherspoon (in a star-making turn), 
      Legally Blonde is a smart and fun adaptation that improves on its source material in every way. 
      Shout-out to the supporting cast, especially Coolidge, Larter, and Blair, for bringing the heart and laughs.
